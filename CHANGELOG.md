- **Adjusted network timings.** The timings reported to Brood War are now more consistent with what
is advertised by the UDP LAN network mode. You probably won't notice any difference, but rest easy
knowing how consistent things are.
- **No more logout surprises.** The avatar in the upper right now does a sensible thing, opening a
menu instead of logging you out immediately.
- **Improved potential dodging speed.** You can now close the Join and Create Game overlays with the
`Escape` key. No need to reach for the mouse when you decide you actually *don't* want to get your
face smashed in by that former WCG qualifier.
