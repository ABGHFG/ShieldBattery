#### 4.0.0 (September 5th, 2016)

- **Changelogs.** We have them now. You're reading one! Astounding! If you can't get enough of
these, they'll also be available to re-read in the avatar menu in the upper right.
- **Feedback has moved.** The button, anyway. Look for it in the avatar menu in the upper right.
- **Team melee, Top vs Bottom, FFA, oh my.** Game modes other than Melee are now supported, so you
can 4v1 an ex-pro on Blue Storm and maybe stand a fighting chance. UMS is still unsupported, but
will be coming soon.
- **Slot switching.** It works now. Click on a slot to move there! Everyone told us this was
impossible, but we did it anyway. Take that, naysayers.
- **Mouse sensitivity now goes to 11.** Or well, it has 11 settings. Your previous setting has been
automatically migrated to the new scale, but you may want to double-check it meets your
expectations. As before, 0 => desktop mouse speed, 10 => mouse speed at native Brood War resolution.
- **Hotkeys.** There are some. `Alt-C` opens the Create Lobby overlay, `Alt-J` for Join Lobby, and
`Alt-S` for settings. More of the hotkeys you'd expect to have (as well as that "type anywhere and
it puts it in the chat box" feature all you spammers want) coming very soon.
- **Lobbies look nicer.** Avatars have been resized, team labels now display when relevant, the
race picker has been reworked a bit, and things generally look a bit more polished. The leave button
has been reworked so that people can find it, as well (or for the real pros, you can also do this
on the navigation entry).
- **Dialogs got a makeover.** Better alignment, improved functionality, and better support for more
complex dialogs in the future.
- **More loading indicators, less boring text.** Who wants to read text when you're waiting for
something to happen? Certainly not us, so now there's more snazzy loading indicators throughout the
site.

#### 3.0.2 (August 23rd, 2016)

- **Adjusted network timings.** The timings reported to Brood War are now more consistent with what
is advertised by the UDP LAN network mode. You probably won't notice any difference, but rest easy
knowing how consistent things are.
- **No more logout surprises.** The avatar in the upper right now does a sensible thing, opening a
menu instead of logging you out immediately.
- **Improved potential dodging speed.** You can now close the Join and Create Game overlays with the
`Escape` key. No need to reach for the mouse when you decide you actually *don't* want to get your
face smashed in by that former WCG qualifier.
