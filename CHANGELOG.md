#### 5.0.0 (February 15th, 2017)

- **Standalone client.** We've moved to a standalone client model, instead of running everything
through your browser. This'll mean faster file browsing, better integration for things like finding
your StarCraft installation (coming soon!), and an easier time for us developers (which means more
features for you!). You can (and will be able to!) continue to use the browser for chat (and for
viewing game results and ladder standings and such once those are in), but you'll need to download
our client to play and watch games and replays. You can go ahead and uninstall our previous
installation as well.
- **Automatic updating.** You won't have to click links in a dialog like a pleb any more! The client
will automatically figure out what version you should be on and download it, prompting you to
restart when it's done. This'll get a lot smoother in the near future, as well!
- **Maps.** You folks like maps, right? We've added Aztec, Demian, Benzen, Bloody Ridge, Neo
Forbidden Zone, and Theatre of War to the pool. Byzantium was also fixed, and the Fastest Map
Possible version was replaced with one from UGL.


#### 4.2.0 (December 11th, 2016)

- **Replay browsing and watching.** Not only do replays save automatically, but now you can watch
them without ever leaving ShieldBattery! Browsing is limited to
`My Documents\Starcraft\maps\replays`, but any replays you put in there will be watchable.
Currently this only allows for single player watching, multiplayer watching is coming soon.
- **Signed installers and files.** All of our installers and files are now signed for extra
assurance that you've received a legitimate copy. This should make some overzealous antiviruses and
operating systems a bit less angry.
- **Maps, maps, and maps, oh maps!** Athena, Outsider, La Mancha, Icarus, and Overwatch (the ASL
version) have been added to the available pool.

#### 4.1.0 (September 27th, 2016)

- **Replay auto-saving.** No more manually renaming LastReplay.rep after every game! Oh the
technology! Replays will be saved to `My Documents\Starcraft\maps\replays\` (on-site replay browsing
and watching coming soon).
- **Chat typing ez-mode.** Press any normal key on chat screens and you'll be helpfully redirected
to the chat input. Type over there! Type over here! Just don't type with beer! (Or do; I'm a
changelog writer, not a cop.)
- **See the lobby list when already in a lobby.** Last update's change around this was easily the
most unpopular one in the entire history of ShieldBattery so... I'm sorry, I'm so very sorry.
- **Some tiny visual things you probably won't notice.** Loading indicator positioning is better,
dialogs without actions no longer have bottom scroll dividers (like this one!). Just trust us, stuff
looks better.
- **More maps.** Primeval Isles, Neo Harmony, New Sniper Ridge, and Polaris Rhapsody are now in the
available pool.

#### 4.0.0 (September 5th, 2016)

- **Changelogs.** We have them now. You're reading one! Astounding! If you can't get enough of
these, they'll also be available to re-read in the avatar menu in the upper right.
- **Feedback has moved.** The button, anyway. Look for it in the avatar menu in the upper right.
- **Team melee, Top vs Bottom, FFA, oh my.** Game modes other than Melee are now supported, so you
can 4v1 an ex-pro on Blue Storm and maybe stand a fighting chance. UMS is still unsupported, but
will be coming soon.
- **Slot switching.** It works now. Click on a slot to move there! Everyone told us this was
impossible, but we did it anyway. Take that, naysayers.
- **Mouse sensitivity now goes to 11.** Or well, it has 11 settings. Your previous setting has been
automatically migrated to the new scale, but you may want to double-check it meets your
expectations. As before, 0 => desktop mouse speed, 10 => mouse speed at native Brood War resolution.
- **Hotkeys.** There are some. `Alt-C` opens the Create Lobby overlay, `Alt-J` for Join Lobby, and
`Alt-S` for settings. More of the hotkeys you'd expect to have (as well as that "type anywhere and
it puts it in the chat box" feature all you spammers want) coming very soon.
- **Lobbies look nicer.** Avatars have been resized, team labels now display when relevant, the
race picker has been reworked a bit, and things generally look a bit more polished. The leave button
has been reworked so that people can find it, as well (or for the real pros, you can also do this
on the navigation entry).
- **Dialogs got a makeover.** Better alignment, improved functionality, and better support for more
complex dialogs in the future.
- **More loading indicators, less boring text.** Who wants to read text when you're waiting for
something to happen? Certainly not us, so now there's more snazzy loading indicators throughout the
site.

#### 3.0.2 (August 23rd, 2016)

- **Adjusted network timings.** The timings reported to Brood War are now more consistent with what
is advertised by the UDP LAN network mode. You probably won't notice any difference, but rest easy
knowing how consistent things are.
- **No more logout surprises.** The avatar in the upper right now does a sensible thing, opening a
menu instead of logging you out immediately.
- **Improved potential dodging speed.** You can now close the Join and Create Game overlays with the
`Escape` key. No need to reach for the mouse when you decide you actually *don't* want to get your
face smashed in by that former WCG qualifier.
