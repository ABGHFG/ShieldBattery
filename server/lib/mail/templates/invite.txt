ShieldBattery Closed Beta

Congratulations! You've been selected to
participate in the ShieldBattery
closed beta.

You'll have an opportunity to test and give
feedback on ShieldBattery before
it is available to a wider audience.
Features and updates will be added as the
beta continues; please remember that this
is a beta, and not all functionality
is final.

We look forward to your feedback, and hope
you enjoy the experience!

You can use the website to chat and do
anything that doesn't require an
installed copy of the game, while the local
client will allow you to use all
available functionality (play games, watch
replays, and more).

of ShieldBattery!
