ShieldBattery Closed Beta
*************************

Congratulations! You've been selected to
participate in the ShieldBattery
closed beta.

You'll have an opportunity to test and give
feedback on ShieldBattery before
it is available to a wider audience.
Features and updates will be added as the
beta continues; please remember that this
is a beta, and not all functionality
is final.

{{#if feedbackUrl}}
As you use the site, please leave
feedback and report bugs at our
feedback form ( {{{feedbackUrl}}} ).
{{/if}}

We look forward to your feedback, and hope
you enjoy the experience!

---------------
Getting started
---------------

Below is your unique signup link. Follow it
and submit the form to create an
account on the site. The email address must
match the one you used to
sign up for an invite, but you may use any
username you wish.

{{{HOST}}}/signup?token={{{token}}}&email={{{escapedEmail}}}


Next, install our software in order to play
games.

{{#if installerUrl}}
Download installer: {{{installerUrl}}}
{{/if}}

Note that Windows may warn you about the
installer; it is safe, and we will
resolve that warning later on in the beta.

After installing, you will utilize the
website for all functionality (chat,
creating and joining games, etc.). There is
no need to run anything from the
installation folder.

Thank you for helping us with the development
of ShieldBattery!
