# Signing the MPQ Archive
In order to sign `snp.mpq`, you will need [Ladik's MPQ Editor](http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html).

After making any changes to the MPQ archive with MPQ Editor, click the toolbar button
labelled **Sign Archive** under the _Operations_ tab. Rebuild the **snp** project and the
game should work as intended.
