Udis86
======

Udis86 is a disassembler engine that decodes a stream of binary machine
code bytes as opcodes defined in the x86 and x86-64 class of Instruction
Set Archictures. The core component of this project is the C library
libudis86 which provides a clean and simple interface to disassemble
binary code, and to inspect the disassembly to various degrees of
details. The library is designed to aid software projects that entail
analysis and manipulation of all flavors of x86 binary code.

libudis86
---------

* Full support for the x86 and x86-64 (AMD64) range of instruction set
  architectures.
* Full support for all AMD-V, INTEL-VMX, MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3,
  SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AES, SMX, FPU(x87), and AMD 3Dnow! instructions.
* Supports 16bit, 32bit, and 64bit disassembly modes.
* Supports instruction meta-data using XML based decode tables.
* Generates output in AT&T or INTEL assembler language syntaxes.
* Supports flexbile input methods: File, Buffer, and Hooks.
* Reentrant.
* Clean and very easy-to-use API.


udcli
-----

udcli is a small command-line tool for your quick disassembly needs.

  $ echo "65 67 89 87 76 65 54 56 78 89 09 00 87" | udcli -32 -x 
  0000000000000000 656789877665    mov [gs:bx+0x6576], eax
  0000000000000000 54              push esp
  0000000000000000 56              push esi
  0000000000000000 7889            js 0x93 
  0000000000000000 0900            or [eax], eax


Documentation
-------------

The libudis86 api is fully documented. The package distribution contains
a Texinfo file which can be installed by invoking "make install-info".
You can also find an online html version of the documentation available
at http://udis86.sourceforget.net/.


Autotools Build
---------------

You need autotools if building from sources cloned form version control
system, or if you need to regenerate the build system. The wrapper
script 'autogen.sh' is provided that'll generate the build system.
